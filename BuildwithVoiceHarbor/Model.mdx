## Advanced vs. Mini


Our Mini and Advanced systems are designed to meet different customer needs when it comes to PHI redaction.

The Mini system harnesses a fine-tuned transformer model to quickly and accurately reduce PHI. Mini is ideal for high-volume or time-sensitive scenarios. Its streamlined architecture ensures that redaction is performed rapidly without compromising on quality, making it an excellent choice for environments where speed is crucial. In fact, Mini is 60% faster than our Advanced solution.

In contrast, the Advanced system leverages a private large language model (LLM) equipped with sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Its integrated reasoning allows for a deeper contextual analysis, ensuring that even subtle or ambiguous PHI elements are accurately identified and redacted. This level of precision is particularly beneficial for applications where data security and comprehensive compliance are paramount.

### Simple model selection example, read more  [here](https://docs.nijta.com/GeneralUsage#minimal-python-usage-of-voice-harbor-api).

```python
# Advanced model:
params = {
    "model": "advanced",
    "agents": ["health-generic"]
}
# Mini model, by default:
params = {
    "model": "mini"
}
```

<Tip>

It's recommended to use the a scheduled download approach if submitting larger amount of volume  with **advanced** models. Read [Documentation](https://docs.nijta.com/api-reference/introduction#scheduled-download-use-case).
