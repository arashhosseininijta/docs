Set Up the Client and Create a Job
Once you have the necessary setup, you can create a job on the server and interact with the API. Here's how to do it:

```python
BASE_URL = "https://voiceharbor.ai"
usage_token = "your_usage_token_here"

# Create a new job on the server via the class method.
# Create a new job immediately.
job_id = VoiceHarborClient.create_job(BASE_URL, usage_token)
print(f"Job created with ID: {job_id}")
```
Next, initialize the client and define the parameters for your job, including the files you want to submit for transcription.

```python
# Initialize the client with the new job_id and input directory.
client = VoiceHarborClient(
    base_url=BASE_URL,
    job_id=job_id,
    token=usage_token,  # Ensure correct token is used here
    inputs_dir="./inputs"
)

# Build job parameters (e.g., list of agents and any other details).
job_params = {
    "model": "advanced",
    "diar": True
    "files": []  # The submit_files method will append uploaded file names.
}

# Upload input files.
job_params = client.submit_files(job_params)
```
Now, submit the job and wait for the transcription results. Here's how to complete the process:

```python
# Immediately submit the job file (YAML)
job_file = client.submit_job(job_params)
print(f"Job file submitted: {job_file}")

# Wait for and download the processed results.
downloaded_results = client.download_results(output_dir="./results")
print("Downloaded results:", downloaded_results)
```
