<Tip>
  We have released our biometric redaction service, read more about all redaction parameters here [Job Parameters](https://docs.nijta.com/BuildwithVoiceHarbor/JobParameters). Just ask, and we'll gladly provide more information on why biometric redaction is the recommended approach to comply 100% with HIPAA and GDPR.
