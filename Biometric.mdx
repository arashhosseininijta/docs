<Tip>
  We have released our biometric redaction service, read more about all redaction parameters here [Job Parameters](https://docs.nijta.com/BuildwithVoiceHarbor/JobParameters). Just ask, and we'll gladly provide more information on why biometric redaction is the recommended approach to comply 100% with HIPAA and GDPR.

## Redact Biometric voice print in audio, followed by transcription using Python SDK

Set Up the Client and Create a Job
Once you have the necessary setup, you can create a job on the server and interact with the API. Here's how to do it:

```python
BASE_URL = "https://voiceharbor.ai"
usage_token = "your_usage_token_here"

# Create a new job on the server via the class method.
# Create a new job immediately.
job_id = VoiceHarborClient.create_job(BASE_URL, usage_token)
print(f"Job created with ID: {job_id}")
```
Next, initialize the client and define the parameters for your job, including the files you want to submit for transcription.

```python
# Initialize the client with the new job_id and input directory.
client = VoiceHarborClient(
    base_url=BASE_URL,
    job_id=job_id,
    token=usage_token,  # Ensure correct token is used here
    inputs_dir="./inputs"
)

# Build job parameters (e.g., list of agents and any other details).
  job_params = {"files": [],
                "task":"biometric",
                "biometric": "en",
                "biometric_gender":"opposite",
                "biometric_age": "middle-aged-adult"}

# Upload input files.
job_params = client.submit_files(job_params)
```
Now, submit the job and wait for the transcription results. Here's how to complete the process:

```python
# Immediately submit the job file (YAML)
job_file = client.submit_job(job_params)
print(f"Job file submitted: {job_file}")



# Wait for and download the processed results.
downloaded_results = client.download_results(output_dir="./results")
print("Downloaded results:", downloaded_results)
```
